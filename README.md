		host: "music-lavalink", //- The host name or IP of the lavalink server.
		port: 2333, // The port that lavalink is listening to. This must be a number!
		password: "bonsoirDocker", //- The password of the lavalink server.
		retryAmount: 200, //- The amount of times to retry connecting to the node if connection got dropped.
		retryDelay: 40, //- Delay between reconnect attempts if connection is lost.

	],
```
5. (Optional) If you want to use dashboard, you need to edit the ``docker-compose.yml`` file to expose the port you set for the API and Dashboard
```
services:
  discord-musicbot:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```
6. Run ``docker compose up -d`` and you have it running
