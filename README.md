## üöß | Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Optionally: [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## üìù | Tutorial

### Written Setup

- Follow the [installation](https://github.com/BioCla/Discord-MusicBot/blob/feature/DJSv14/djs-bot/README.md) procedure for the bot
- Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (and [CMake](https://cmake.org/)) installed on your machine
  - If you are planning on running the bot through docker on windows, then you'll have to use WSL and set up the appropriate docker configurations for that [(click here)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/)
- Open a terminal session in in the root directory of the project
- Run `make help` to see the list of available commands
  - If you don't have or can't install makefile utilities then run `./dc.sh help`

### Docker setup

Setup the ports in a docker-compose.override.yml file in the docker directory. 
 - Or rename the docker-compose.override.yml.dist file to docker-compose.override.yml and fill in the values if they are not already filled in.

The file should look like this:
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  postgres-db:
    ports:
      - xxxx:xxxx
  lavalink:
    ports:
      - 2333:2333
```

Make a `.env` in the same directory as the docker-compose.override.yml file. 
 - Or rename the `.env.dist` file to `.env` and fill in the values if they are not already filled in.

The file should look like this:
```bash
POSTGRES_DB=base
POSTGRES_USER=root
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
```

- Run `make up log` to start the docker environment and view the logs. 
- You can also run `make up` to start the docker environment in the background.
