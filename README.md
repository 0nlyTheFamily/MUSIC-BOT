## üìù Tutorial
If you would like to host the bot on a local pc, follow these steps - 
  1) Clone the repo from the `code` button above and copy the link under the HTTP section.
     
      Open a shell window where you want the bot to be placed in and then type the following:
       ```
       git clone https://github.com/joeyk710/Discord-MusicBot.git
       ```

  2) Insert your bot token into the `.env` file. 
  
     If you have issues getting a bot token, follow this guide - https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Getting-a-Bot-Token

  3) Open an integrated terminal (if using Visual Studio) and type ```npm i```

  4) After the `node-modules` have been all downloaded and you have placed your bot token in the `.env` file, type `node index.js`.

      If the bot says `[API] Logged in as (bot name)` without errors, the bot is fully functional! 
      If you get an error similar to this: 
      ```
      Cannot find module (name)
      ```
      Type `npm i (module name from error)` and then type `node index.js` to see if the error is fixed!
